## Me

Physics post-undergrad student, University of Science and Technology of China(2017-2021), Future Fate Undetermined(2022-). Love physics and programming, hardware tweaking, and reinventing the wheel -- so much hobbies isn't it. 

My long-term interest is amateur osdev with custom RISC-V core/peripheral on FPGA. 

<!--Check what I'm doing now on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/6mXRwLXy/projects). -->

I also like designing printed circuit boards and scavenging re-purposed hardware. I have FPGA boards with Xilinx/Altera/Lattice chips, from small iCE40HX1K to large xc7vx415t. 

Blogs and comics, recently more comics than blogs, about tech stuff and sometimes life stuff can be found here -- I'll update monthly if I can! All licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 or CC0 so feel free to forward/post anywhere else!

And I am a crappy NetHack player: Delightful in darkness, delicious in dungeon. 

I also like Undertale, Darkest Dungeon, Hollow Knight, Mindustry, Dead Cells, and a lot more games.
