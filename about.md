## About Me
Physics post-undergrad at University of Science and Technology of China(2017-2021). Love physics and programming, and reinventing the wheel. Future fate undetermined. 

My long-term interest is amateur osdev with custom RISC-V core/peripheral on FPGA. Check what I'm doing now on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/6mXRwLXy/projects). 

I also like designing printed circuit boards and scavenging re-purposed hardware. I have FPGA boards with Xilinx/Altera/Lattice chips, from small iCE40HX1K to large xc7k325t. 

Blogs and comics about tech stuff(and sometimes life stuff) can be found here -- I'll update monthly if I can! 

And I am a crappy NetHack player: Delightful in darkness, delicious in dungeon. I also like Mindustry and Undertale.
