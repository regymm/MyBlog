## About Me
I'm a physics student at University of Science and Technology of China, grade 2017. Love physics and programming, and reinventing the wheel.  
  
Blogs and comics about tech stuff can be found here -- I'll update monthly if I can!  
  
And I'm a crappy NetHack player: Delightful in darkness, delicious in dungeon!
