## About Me
Physics undergrad at University of Science and Technology of China(2017-2021). Love physics and programming, and reinventing the wheel. Future fate undetermined. 

My current interest is amateur osdev with custom RISC-V core/peripheral on FPGA: currently RV32IM + M-mode CSR no MMU / boot from SD card / microkernel, process switching, IPC, load ELF. 

Blogs and comics about tech stuff(and sometimes life stuff) can be found here -- I'll update monthly if I can! 

And I *was* a crappy NetHack player: Delightful in darkness, delicious in dungeon. Now I play Mindustry. I also like Mindustry and Undertale.
